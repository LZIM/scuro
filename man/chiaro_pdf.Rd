\title{A format for article classes}
\usage{
chiaro_pdf(fig_width = 4, fig_height = 2, fig_crop = TRUE,
  fig_caption = TRUE, dev = "tikz", highlight = "zenburn",
  keep_tex = TRUE, latex_engine = "xelatex", plot_font = "mainfont")
}
\arguments{
\item{fig_width}{Natural figure width in inches. This is rescaled according
to the value of chunk option \code{out.width} (by default, configured to use
the natural width or the textwidth, whichever is smaller).}

\item{fig_height}{Natural figure height in inches.
\code{fig_width/fig_height} is the aspect ratio of the graphic.}

\item{fig_crop}{Apply \code{pdfcrop}? Set by default.}

\item{dev}{graphics device (\code{tikz}) by default.}

\item{latex_engine}{\code{xelatex} by default}

\item{plot_font}{If both XeLaTeX and TikZ are used, the package will set the
font in graphics. Any system font name can be given. The default value
\code{mainfont} selects the document main font.}
}
\value{
An R Markdown format suitable for rendering.
}
\description{
This format is meant to supply only the TikZ-wrangling features of the
package and to set up reasonable further defaults for an article rather than
a presentation. For slides that use scuro's font and figure-drawing setup
but not its color scheme, use \code{\link{scuro_md}} but with format option
\code{scuro=FALSE}. The built-in \code{\link[rmarkdown]{render}} is flexible 
enough to handle all the processing from R markdown to PDF,
including citation processing where needed.
}
\details{
Among defaults selected here, of particular note are centering alignment for
figures, a black-and-white ggplot theme, and stop-on-error. Errors,
warnings, and messages will all go to the console, not into the final
document. The intermediate LaTeX file will also be kept as this is often
necessary to diagnose typesetting errors.
